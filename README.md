## Node
We can think of a node as a container for some data. It can be conceptually visualized as a circle that we can put some data inside. We can store any data type in a node.

* tail - the very last node that has its next pointer pointing to nothing or has its next set to null. 
* head - the very first node. A head has a position of 0.

## Linked Lists
A linked list contains a bunch of nodes linked together. We can consider a linked list ordered data structure.

## Linked Lists & Arrays
* An array must be stored contiguously (right next to each other) in memory. 
* An linked list does not require its nodes stored contiguously in memory. 

## Usage
$ node linkedLists.js
